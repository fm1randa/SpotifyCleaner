# SpotifyCleaner
A simple script to convert an explicit Spotify playlist into a non-explicit one

Takes a given Spotify playlist and checks every song and attempts to find a non-explicit version of it and add it to a clean version of the playlist. Songs that are already non-explicit are included. If a clean version of a song cannot be found then the song is not included.
